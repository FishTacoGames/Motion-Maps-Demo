Extract the zip (or copy & paste the "MotionMapsDemo" folder from the zip in your downloads) to any folder and launch the exe.

Unfortunatly RenderTextureArrays are not supported on WEBGL.

This is a limited demo of about 1km of grass. Async scene Loading is disabled.
Use the visualizer to see the result of the render texture array. 
The grass shader is a basic proof of concept for deformation. 
Currently the max array size is limited to ease testing and lower performance cost on low end machines -
this can effect border transitions with clearing old information. 
This Demo does not represent the final state of this project.
