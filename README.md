Extract the zip (or copy & paste the "MotionMapsDemo" folder from the zip in your downloads) to any folder and launch the exe.

Unfortunatly RenderTextureArrays are not supported on WEBGL.

Controls: WASD to move, Mouse to look, Space to jump, Shift to run, Escape to show cursor & Right Click to focus cursor/window.

This is a limited demo of about 1km of grass. Async scene Loading is disabled.
Walk around/use the visualizer to see the result of the render texture array. 
The grass shader is a basic proof of concept for deformation. 
Currently the max array size is limited to ease testing and lower performance cost on low end machines -
this can effect border transitions with clearing old information. 
This Demo does not represent the final state of this project.

If you are prompted with windows defender click "More info" and Run anyway. You can view the project scripting contents in DemoProjectFiles.
